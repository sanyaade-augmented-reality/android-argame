= Code Style Guidelines =
== Whitespace ==
  * Indention: 2 spaces (no tabs), 4 spaces for line continuations
  * Line Length: 100 characters
  * Braces: Same line starting, new line ending, space before opening brace
  * Operators: Space before and after
  * Parenthesis: No spacing inside

== Comments ==
  * All functions must be prefaced with comments.
  * All classes must be prefaced with javadocs.
  * No @author tags in javadocs

== Autoformatters ==
Download the below xml file and save it to your local disk. Import this formatter in eclipse with Window --> Preferences --> Java --> Code Style --> Formatter and choose "Import..." and find this file on disk. Now, when you select code in eclipse, Ctrl + Shift + F will auto format it. Avoid auto-formatting entire classes if you're touching small parts, since it makes the code review unnecessarily large.
